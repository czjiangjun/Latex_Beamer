\title{\rm{DFT~Song}}

(oririnal song)
When I find myself in time of trouble\\
Mother Mary comes to me\\
Speaking words of wisdom\\
Let it be\\

And in my hour of darkness\\
She is standing right in front of me\\
Speaking words of wisdom\\
Let it be\\

Let it be, Let it be, Let it be\\
Whisper words of wisdom\\
Let it be

(by Volker Blum and Kieron Burke)\\
To the turne of Let it Be (with apologizes to John and Paul)\\
When I find my model's unpredictive,\\
Walter Kohn just comes to me,\\
speaking words of wisdom,
DFTee.\\
And in my hour of code-debugging,\\
he stands right in front of meee,\\
saying ``you jut gotta learn\\
your chemistree.''\\
LSD,~PBE\\
B3LYP, hee-hee-hee,\\
Which approximation should I use,\\
in my DFTee?\\

And in my hour of darkness,\\
with molecules all in front of meee\\
Which value should I choose,\\
For chemical accuraceee?\\
For if I fit two dozen numbers\\
From the set called G-three-ee,
Have I left the path\\
Of functional puriteee?\\

DFT, DFT,\\
Mel Leveeen, inequalitee,\\
I can always scale my functional,\\
to check its pedigree.\\

But when my band gap's tiny,\\
for too small for all to see\\
I don't like your answer,\\
DFTee.\\
For though it may be parted\\
with a hybrid E-X-Cee,\\
Can I trust my answer,\\
in realitee?

DFT,DFT,\\
DFT,DFTee\\
I thought you were first-principles,\\
DFTee.\\

And when the broken-hearted gap,\\
open up to full degree\\
How'll I get the answer,\\
tell me DFTee?\\
For though the band gap may be parted,\\
there's a chance that you will see\\
GW is the answer,\\
thank you Rex Godbee\\

Many bod-eee, not DFT,\\
Many bod-eee, no densitee,\\
This must be the answer,\\
on which we'll all agree!\\

And when I've found the structure,\\
there's still a light that shiness on me,\\
So Walter will not let me use,\\
ground-state DFTee.\\
To find the optical spectrum,\\
while staying p'rameter-free\\
We must ask a little Gross,\\
the one called Hardeee.\\

DFT,123,
now TD-,DFT\\
Let's get excitions,\\
with more skulduggeree.\\

(Last chorus):\\
DFT,DFT,\\
It's the weirdest physics,\\
but makes great chemistree.
