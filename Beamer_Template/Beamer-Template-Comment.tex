An animation to the area of calculation using the upper Riemann sum.

That's an approximation of an integral by a finite sum, named after the
German mathematician Riemann. It is calculated by partitioning the region
below the the curve into rectangles and summarizing their areas. To get
a better approximation, the region is devided more finely. As the rectangles
get smaller, the Rieman sum approaches the Riemann integral.
This animation shows it.
